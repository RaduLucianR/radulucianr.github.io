I am an embedded systems engineer, with a significant portion of my work now in robotics, specifically in [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). 

The programming languages I know best are C, C++, Java and Python. My abilities are not limitied to these of course, I know many programming languages and frameworks, too many [to fit here](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/miscellany/fermats-last-margin-note). For more information see my [CV](https://rlradulescu.com/cv) and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/radu-lucian-radulescu/), and check out my [portfolio](https://rlradulescu.com/portfolio/) and my [Github](https://github.com/RaduLucianR) to see what practical projects I've done.

I interned at [Starnus Technology](https://www.starnustech.com/), [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en) and [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/nl-en). I was in the Board of [Team Polar](https://www.teampolar.org/) when we constructed an RC-controlled 350kg-heavy prototype rover for Antarctic research. I conducted research about cybercriminalsâ€™ preference of underground markets and co-authored [this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.05898). I am now in the final stages of my Master of Embedded Systems at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/).

I enjoy bouldering, hiking, skiing, classical dances. I like watching films, playing chess and reading both fiction and non-fiction. Of course, I also code in my free time, mostly re-making tools from scratch, like this [shell](https://github.com/RaduLucianR/frozesh).
