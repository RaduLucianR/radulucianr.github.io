Education
======
* M.Sc. in Embedded Systems, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e), 2025 (expected)
* B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e), 2022

Work experience
======

**Embedded Software Engineer**, [*ASML*](https://www.asml.com/), July 2023 - December 2023
  * Full-time internship
  * Designed a framework for hardware-in-the-loop end-to-end test automation with behavior-driven development
  * Implemented Python libraries with RobotFramework that used OPC UA and XML-RPC as communication protocols
  * Expanded the Matlab/Simulink plant model that simulates the temperature properties of the machine
  * Implemented state machines for simulating electronic components’ behavior in C++ with Boost
  * Eliminated the need for end-to-end manual testing and integrated the framework in the CI/CD pipeline

* **Robotics Software Engineer**, [*Starnus Technology*](https://www.starnustech.com/), July 2023 - December 2023
  * Full-time internship for Bachelor Thesis
  * Starnus Technology is a startup specializing in custom autonomous mobile robots for logistics applications
  * Developed infrastructure that allows users to send commands and create missions for robots via a web application
  * Designed the system’s architecture, containing a Vue web application, a Springboot server and ROS nodes
  * Developed ROS nodes with C++, a robot simulation in Gazebo, web sockets in Java on the Springboot server
  * Collaborated in a SCRUM team of 10 students, following Agile principles, using Git and integrating CI/CD

* **Operations Manager & Software Engineer**, [*Team Polar*](https://www.teampolar.org/), September 2021 - July 2023
  * Team Polar is a student team that develops a solar powered autonomous vehicle that facilitates Antarctic research
  * Oversaw the organization and direction of the Team’s ~25 members as Operations Manager in the Team’s Board
  * Implemented a vehicle simulation with ROS, Gazebo, C++; installed mechanical parts; soldered wires
  * Created a 2D animation in Adobe After Effects that presents the Team’s mission to a non-technical audience
  * Oversaw the construction of the Team’s first prototype, a €40,000 remote-controlled rover weighing 350kg
  * Successfully tested the prototype in Norway in January 2023 which can be seen [here](https://www.teampolar.org/the-rover-1).

* **Teaching Assistant**, *Technische Universiteit Eindhoven*, September 2020 - July 2023
  * Part-time job
  * Duties include: 
    * Teach small-sized (8 students) groups
    * Lead medium-sized (30-40 students) Q&A sessions
    * Grade mathematical proofs, pseudo-code algorithms
    * Grade programming assignments (Java, ARM Assembly, Haskell)

Research experience
======
* **Student researcher**, *Division of Electronics and Embedded Systems of Kungliga tekniska Hogskolan (KTH)*, February 2024 - June 2024
  * Erasmus+ full-time internship
  * Investigating latency improvements for ROS2 systems via task-to-executor allocation schemes
  * Created a framework for deploying run-time generated ROS2 executor architectures for fast iteration experiments
  
* **Student researcher**, *Security Group (SEC) of TU/e*, November 2021 - April 2022
  * Investigated cybercriminals’ preference of underground markets by inspecting their activities on 23 illegal markets
  * Created web scrapers in Python and compiled a database with data about 480 cybercriminals
  * Determined the common features of the illegal markets that are visited by notorious cybercriminals
  * Co-authored a paper presenting the results, published at WEIS ’23, accessible [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.05898)
  
* **Student researcher**, *Smart Mobility track of the Honors Academy of TU/e*, September 2020 - May 2021
  * Investigated estimating optical flow in an unsupervised way
  * Implemented neural networks with Pytorch for image classification (ResNet), semantic segmentation (DeepLab)
  * Designed an optical flow network that calculates the loss from the output frame and a reconstructed second frame
  * Implemented the reconstructor by using the generator of Pix2Pix, an image-to-image translation network
  * Analyzed the approach with confusion matrices, loss graphs, wrote a comprehensive report about the findings
